//! Tests probing several specific N3 characteristics flagged by a TBL-lens
//! re-audit: (1) whether nested quoted graphs (a formula containing another
//! formula) are handled without corrupting data or crashing, (2) whether
//! forward chaining correctly threads a derived fact from one rule into a
//! second rule's antecedent within the same `materialize()` fixpoint
//! (chained implication), and (3) `@forAll`/`@forSome` quantifier scoping
//! (see `lib/src/parser/n3rule_parser.rs`'s `ScopeStack`). (1) and (2) are
//! additive probes over the existing `log:implies`/quoted-graph
//! implementation in `lib/src/reasoner/log_implies.rs` and `lib/src/term.rs`
//! -- see those files' doc comments for the underlying mechanism
//! (`FORMULA_REGISTRY`, `process_log_implies_rule`).
//!
//! ## Documented scoping conflict (read before touching quantifier tests)
//!
//! Real N3 formula scoping would make EVERY bare (unquantified) variable
//! scoped to its smallest enclosing formula, so the same bare name reused in
//! two sibling quoted formulas would never collide even without an explicit
//! `@forAll`/`@forSome`. That reading is NOT what's implemented here, because
//! it directly conflicts with `log_implies.rs`'s dynamic `log:implies`
//! reification, which its own doc comment says is "matched across
//! antecedent/consequent/outer scopes purely by *name*" -- and the
//! `test_chained_implication_through_log_implies_*` tests below rely on
//! exactly that: `?citizen` bare in the top-level quoted formula
//! `:alice :says { ?citizen a :GoodCitizen }` must be the SAME variable as
//! the bare `?citizen` in the unrelated formula `{ ?citizen a :TaxPayer }`
//! nested inside a rule body, or the derivation never grounds. Auto-scoping
//! every bare variable per-formula would break that. So: this engine scopes
//! ONLY variables an author explicitly names in `@forAll`/`@forSome` (the
//! literal, spec-accurate meaning of those two declarations); bare variables
//! keep the pre-existing flat, name-based identity across formula
//! boundaries. The tests below lock in the explicit-quantifier behavior.
