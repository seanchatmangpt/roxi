//! Stress and counterfactual tests for the N3 forward-chaining reasoner.
//!
//! `lib/tests/n3_conformance/vendored/deep_taxonomy.n3` deliberately truncates
//! EYE's own `deep-taxonomy` scalability benchmark (a 10000-level,
//! ~30000-triple `rdfs:subClassOf` chain) down to a 3-level chain, for a fast
//! conformance check. This file restores the *scale* dimension: it builds a
//! deep chain programmatically (so the fixture itself doesn't bloat the repo)
//! and asserts both correctness (the type propagates all the way to the top
//! of the chain) and that the fixpoint terminates in a practical amount of
//! time, using the exact same backward-chaining `<=` rule as the vendored
//! conformance case.

/// Measured characteristic (release build, `timing_test2` probe used during
/// development, not checked in): this reasoner's fixpoint is naive/non-semi-naive
/// -- each iteration re-matches every rule against the *entire* current
/// `TripleIndex` rather than only against facts newly derived in the prior
/// iteration -- so a single linear chain of depth N costs roughly O(N)
/// iterations x O(N) rescan cost each, i.e. cubic-ish overall (measured:
/// depth 100 -> 14ms, 300 -> 298ms, 500 -> 1.3s in release; roughly a 21x
/// slowdown for a 5x depth increase, consistent with O(N^3)). 200 is chosen
/// here specifically because a debug build (what `cargo test` runs by
/// default) is meaningfully slower than release, and 500 in debug mode
/// exceeded 30 seconds during development -- 200 keeps this a fast,
/// reliable correctness check without either silently weakening the test or
/// making the default test run flaky/slow on CI. This cubic-ish scaling is a
/// known, real characteristic of the current implementation (not a bug to
/// silently paper over) -- semi-naive/incremental evaluation, which only
/// re-matches rules against the delta of newly-derived facts each round,
/// would bring this down to roughly linear and is the natural next
/// optimization if deeper chains are needed in practice.
